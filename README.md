# OpenScience-Reflections

### _An open conversation about openness_

---

## Purpose

This repository documents reflections on the philosophy, practice, and infrastructure of **Open Science**.  
It serves as a living forum where researchers discuss reproducibility, transparency, ethics, and collaboration — not as abstract ideals, but as practices implemented day by day in modern laboratories.

We see openness as a **method of thinking**, not a bureaucratic requirement.

## Context

Initiated by Ulrich Warring (University of Freiburg, Physikalisches Institut, AG Schätz),  
this project complements ongoing work in quantum control and reproducible scientific infrastructure (e.g., the *Network-Bias-Dynamics* and *LabNodes* frameworks).
